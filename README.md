# Minecraft-Friday-the-13th-Maps-and-Game-Information
A community project repository to add and have a bunch of Minecraft Friday the 13th maps for the Bedrock Edition so that everyone can easily get access to all the maps. The maps are all up to date, with all the commands with appropriate roles, texture pack, and no name tags. I want this project to be where people can add maps that they have, so everyone can have access to them. So if you have any maps please share. I will have a video down below on how to add files to this project:

# Rules and how to play Friday the 13th

## How to play Friday the 13th

Each player will go through the Randomizer, and they will get a colored wool block or dye that is associated with a shulker box. If a player gets a black wool or dye they are Jason. The round will start once Jason has hide all the escaping materials. There is 5 ways to escape, one of them is an optional choice to use as an escape. Make sure you have enough materials for each Camper to escape. Once Jason has hid the items around the map. The Game can start. Each player will in to a separate pod and use a minecart to get in to the map. Campers can open and close doors, But Jason can not open or close the door. If a door is close then Jason needs to break it down. If a Camper uses a pocket knife or firecracker, Jason has to stand still until the effect wears off.
